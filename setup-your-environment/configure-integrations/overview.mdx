Integrations allow Blockaid to perform actions on your behalf on your specific tools, such as send messages and notifications, push webhook events, make API calls, submit onchain transactions and more.

Blockaid integrations fall into four main categories:

* **[Notifications](https://docs.blockaid.io/docs/set-up-notification-integrations#/)** - Send alerts and updates to you and your team when specific events occur, supporting real-time awareness and response.
* **[Web Actions](https://docs.blockaid.io/docs/set-up-web-action-integrations#/)** - Automate security workflows by making remote calls to external systems, improving response speed and consistency.
* **[Blockaid Security Modules](https://docs.blockaid.io/docs/set-up-integrations-for-blockaid-security-modules#/)** - Integrate Blockaid's Operational Security tooling for enhanced protection and incident handling.
